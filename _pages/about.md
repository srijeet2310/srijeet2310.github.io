Aspiring to be a computer scientist, I am currently working as a systems engineer at [Nvidia Graphics](https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/) and as an independent researcher at the [Haute Ecole Spécialisée de Suisse Occidentale](https://www.hes-so.ch/accueil), Valais-Wallis, Switzerland in collaboration with Professor [Andrea Guerrieri](https://people.hes-so.ch/en/profile/7560748869-andrea-guerrieri). I have a long history of working with hardware prefetchers, caches, field programmable gate arrays, multi-core processors, general-purpose graphical processing units, post-quantum cryptographic cores, and heterogeneous processing systems. I had the privilege of pursuing my undergraduate thesis at the [Processor Architecture Laboratory](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lap/) at [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), Switzerland under the guidance of Professors [Paolo Ienne](https://people.epfl.ch/paolo.ienne) and [Andrea Guerrieri](https://people.hes-so.ch/en/profile/7560748869-andrea-guerrieri). Previously, I have worked as a software engineer at the IOSXE Polaris Team in [Cisco Systems](https://www.cisco.com/c/en_in/index.html) and interned at the [Edinburgh Architecture and Systems Lab](https://easelab.inf.ed.ac.uk/) in the [University of Edinburgh](https://ed.ac.uk/). I majored in electrical and electronics engineering during my undergraduate degree at the [Birla Institute of Technology and Science - Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/).

During my undergraduate thesis, I co-authored and co-developed [DynaRapid](https://sites.google.com/view/dynarapid/) to reduce compilation times of placed and routed kernel designs from C/C++ codes for commercial FPGAs. For this publication, I am the recipient of the Michal Servit Award at the 34th IEEE International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications held in Torino, Italy.
