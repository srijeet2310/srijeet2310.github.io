  title={Precision Unwound: Fine-Tuning Loop Unrolling for Energy-efficient FPGA-based PQC using HLS},
  author={Guha, Srijeet and Guerrieri, Andrea},
  abstract={High-Level Synthesis (HLS) is a valuable tool for designing hardware accelerators for Post-quantum Cryptography (PQCs). However, while HLS can efficiently map high-level code to hardware, the quality of the synthesized hardware in terms of latency, power, and area is sensitive to various design parameters and configurations, such as loop unrolling, pipelining, and dataflow optimizations. In this work, we explore the effects of loop unrolling on the execution time and the energy efficiency of the final PQC. We demonstrate that, despite initial expectations, loop unrolling could worsen the performance.},

  title={Iterative Frequency Tuning Targeting Energy Efficiency Ratio for FPGA-based Post-Quantum Cryptographic Cores},
  author={Guha, Srijeet and Guerrieri, Andrea},
  abstract={Electronic Design Automation tools such as high- level synthesis (HLS) have raised the level of abstraction, allowing the use of FPGAs in multiple domains, including post-quantum cryptography (PQC). Among power performance area (PPA) tradeoffs, the energy efficiency ratio is of increasing interest, especially with the need to integrate PQC cores into battery-powered portable appliances. Nevertheless, to target energy efficiency at the HLS level, post-place, and route metrics should be taken into account, which is extremely time-consuming. In this paper, we developed an iterative frequency tuning framework capable of extracting the best quality, energy-efficient design in logarithmic time complexity, converging to the best design frequency with a speedup of 2.89x with respect to the classical approach. The framework also allows the selection of the criticality of each metric thus altering the design cost function to suit the requirements of the HLS designers. The framework and the results will be released as open-source, allowing HLS designers to design the highest energy efficiency ratio PQC cores quickly.},

  title={DynaRapid: Fast-tracking from C to routed circuits},
  author={Guerrieri, Andrea and Guha, Srijeet and Lavin, Chris and Hung, Eddie and Josipovic, Lana and Ienne, Paolo},
  abstract={Advancements in design automation technologies, such as high-level synthesis (HLS), have raised the input abstraction level and made the design entry process for FPGAs more friendly to software programmers. In contrast, the backend compilation process for implementing designs on FPGAs is considerably more lengthy compared to software compilation: while software code compilation may take just a few seconds, FPGA compilation times can often span from several minutes to hours due to the complexity of the underlying toolchain and ever- growing device capacities. In this paper, we present DynaRapid, a fast compilation tool that generates—in a matter of seconds— fully legal placed-and-routed designs for commercial FPGAs. Elastic circuits created by the HLS tool Dynamatic are made exclusively of a limited number of reusable components; we exploit this fact to create a library of placed and routed building blocks, and then stitch together instances of them as needed through RapidWright. Our approach accelerates the C-to-FPGA implementation process by a geomean 20× with only 10% of degradation in operating frequency compared to a conventional commercial off-the-shelf implementation flow.},

In this paper, we present DynaRapid, a very fast compilation tool that generates in a matter of seconds fully-legal placed-and-routed designs for commercial FPGAs. We leverage the inherently modular nature of dataflow circuits created by the HLS tool Dynamatic and combine it with the implementation manipulation capabilities provided by RapidWright. Our approach accelerates the C-to-FPGA implementation process by up to 33x with only 20% of degradation in operating frequency compared to a conventional commercial off-the-shelf implementation flow.},
